<figcaption>Figure 1: Thermo Scientific Dionex™ CR-ATC Continuously Regenerated Anion/Cation Trap Column designed to remove contaminants anion/cation from the eluent/influent water. The devices are designed for 5000 psi operation. For anion applications removes all anionic contaminants from the eluent post eluent generation cartridge and provides a pure eluent stream for chromatographic operation conferring low background, blanks and reproducible separations.  </figcaption>

<figcaption>Figure 2: Thermo Scientific Dionex™ DRS-600 Suppressor for Ion Chromatography - Suppressor can be operated in constant voltage mode with no user interaction or with constant current settings. The device was designed by using the ERS500 hardware and changes to the ion exchange packing to improve current efficiency and operation under constant voltage conditions.General purpose self-regenerating suppressor for majority of applications. Gives lowest noise for RFIC-EG hydroxide and MSA eluents for gradient applications. Replaces Thermo Scientific™ Dionex™ ERS™ 500 Electrolytically Regenerated Suppressor.</figcaption>

        <img src="images/ERS-500-Suppressors.jpg" alt="" width = "200">
<figcaption>Figure 3: Thermo Scientific Dionex™ ERS 500e suppressor is electrolytically regenerated suppressor designed for constant current operation and external water mode; compatible with solvents up to 40%, borate eluents and destructive
detectors such as MS and PCR</figcaption>

<figcaption>Figure 4: Thermo Scientific Dionex™ ERS™ 500e Electrolytically Regenerated Suppressor Optimized for carbonate eluents with a unique design and results in <1.5 nS/cm noise with most carbonate eluents and conductivity detection</figcaption>
</figure>
<img src="images/CRS-500-Suppressor-824x525.jpg" alt="" width = "200">
<figcaption>Figure 5: Thermo Scientific Dionex™ CRS 500 Chemically Regenerated Suppressor is designed for applications requiring high levels of solvent added to the eluent and for samples containing high levels of matrix ions. The design includes features that improve the chemical capacity and diminishes retention of contaminants in the suppressor. The same suppressor when configured for the Anion device with TBA form became the suppressor for Anion Ion exclusion chromatography or known as the ICE suppressor</figcaption>

<img src="images/Salt Converter.jpg" alt="" width = "200">
<figcaption>Figure 6: Thermo Scientific Dionex™ SC-CERS™ 500 Salt Converter-Cation Electrolytically Regenerated Suppressor is designed for analysis of weak bases such as ammonia and amines with a linear calibration response by converting the analytes to the salt form followed by the methane sulfonic acid form</figcaption>

<figcaption>Figure 7: Thermo Scientific Dionex™ ERD™ 500
Electrolytically Regenerated Desalter is designed for removing sodium ions from electrochemical detector effluent prior to MS detection or fraction collection</figcaption>
</figure>
<img src="images/Gas Assisted Regeneration.jpg" alt="" width = "400">
<figcaption>Figure 8: Thermo Scientific Dionex™ Gas Assisted Regeneration kit is used in legacy systems with legacy suppressors to lower the noise by regenerating the suppressor with a combination of suppressed eluent and an inert gas such as nitrogen to create a higher velocity in the regenerant channel and conferring the benefits of the external water mode without the aqueous waste and by reducing the chromatographic baseline noise significantly. Modern suppressors do not need this mode of operation. </figcaption>
</figure>
<img src="images/DCR Kit.jpg" alt="" width = "400">
<figcaption>Figure 9: Thermo Scientific Dionex™ DCR kit is used for implementing the displacement regeneration mode of operation where chemical suppression with reagents is pursued without a regenerant pump. The benefit of using the recycled effluent is that the noise is substantially low as opposed to the pulsing noise from the regenerant pumps. This mode has a lower dynamic capacity of suppression than the standard chemical mode but without generating the large waste that is typically generated with the conventional chemical mode of operation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<img src="images/CRD.jpg" alt="" width = "200">
<figcaption>Figure 10: Thermo Scientific Dionex™ Dionex™ CRD 180, 200 and 300 Carbonate Removal Device is used post suppressor for removing the CO2 from the carbonic acid eluent or sample thereby lowering the background signal from dissolved carbon dioxide in the suppressed eluent. The device was designed with proprietary CO2 removal membranes. The benefit of this device is higher sensitivity for peaks while lowering the background signal or peaks stemming from carbon dioxide thus increasing the detection of ionic species with conductivity detection.  The unit can also be used to degas the sample streams provided the sample stream is acidic (for dissolved species such as carbon dioxide) and basic (for dissolved species like ammonia). The Dionex CRD 300 was designed for use with carbonate eluent-based chemistries, while the Dionex CRD 180 and 200 were designed for use with hydroxide- and borate-based chemistries. A base stream is applied in a counter current direction to the eluent flow to remove the dissolved carbon dioxide as carbonate. The base stream can be recycled suppressor waste for hydroxide and borate chemistries. Similarly a vacuum can be applied to remove the dissolved carbon dioxide.</figcaption>

<img src="images/Charge Detector.jpg" alt="" width = "400">
<figcaption>Figure 11: Thermo Scientific Dionex™ Charge Detector (QD) responds to ionic
species by drawing a current at a fixed potential. When combined as a post conductivity detection for suppressed conductivity detection, charge detection can be utilized as a confirmatory detector to validate ionic species and obtain additional information on the separation. The detector is presently designed for capillary format operation. </figcaption>
