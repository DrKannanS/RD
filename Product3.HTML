    <section id="Key Contributions">
      <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
      <p>Governance focus: Reviewed new product architecture; Identified key differentiators; Technical support on UL/certifications; Initiated standup Meetings for Visibility, Cross-functional accountability & Escalations</p>

    <section id="challenge">
      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>Legacy environmental chambers do not have the required modern features such as a modern UI, connectivity for data storage and monitoring and consume large water volumes and energy for operation. Further they lack adequate and controlled lighting for growth applications. Also the dimensions were not optimized for some laboratories and the instrument was not mobile enough for easy install in the lab </p>
    </section>

    <section id="solution">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p> The solution was to create a chamber ground up with modern features such as a modern UI with touch control and connectivity for data storage and monitoring via the USB port. The unit was designed with Peltier technology to facilitate fast cooling and heating and dehumidification. The unit had very low water consumption and energy consumption.</p>

      <h2>Innovation</h2>
      <p>Peltier based design for refrigeration brought energy savings and sustainability benefits such as reduction of carbon foot print of 80 tons of CO2 equivalents in production and service and reduction of energy (80%) and water consumption (99% reduction) relative to the legacy unit was also observed with careful optimization of the design/operational parameters. The control of multiple parameters such as Temperature, Humidity, Light with LED (new feature) and CO2 was feasible expanding the applications for this instrument. Several patent applications were filed</p>
