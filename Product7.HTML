<section id="Key Contributions">
      <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
      <p>Governance focus: Reviewed new product architecture; Identification of Key differentiators; FTO & IP filings; Contributed to design - GUI & Ease of access to key components</p>

    <section id="challenge">
      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>Legacy mid-tier systems require modern features and differentiation to be adopted by customers in the future. Customers need usage information and easy installation of consumables for ion chromatography. </p>
    </section>

    <section id="solution">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>Installation and use information needs to be available on prem. Further it would be ideal to create a less complex platform and make ion chromatography components easy to install without compromising performance. Ability to use smaller particle packed columns can improve the speed of separation and can reduce the eluent usage</p>

    <section id="innovation">
      <h2>Innovation</h2>
      <p>The design adopted modern design for the display and the key components of the system giving an illusion of a modular system but offering clearly laid out system components to simplify plumbing and troubleshooting for the customer. Further automated processing of methods, with training videos for equilibrating and installing consumables and monitor the operation and provide real time feedback and troubleshooting to support the uptime of the system. Several patents were filed on the key features and consumables were optimized for operation at higher pressures of 5000 psi. </p>

    <section id="value">
      <h2>Value</h2>
      <p>The design elements were aligned to provide improved system uptime for customers. Monitoring of consumable wellness parameters and alerts that provide feedback to the customer about the care needed to maintain optimum performance. Automated consumable configuration checks prevent installation errors. Less downtime, more results. The system provided versatile and efficient separations for ion analysis and was future ready to accomodate any future needs with a variety of powersupplies and detectors in a compact format. </p>
