    <h1>Examples of New Product Development</h1>
    New Generation CO2 Incubator for Cell & Gene Therapy and Clinical Applications
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <section id="challenge">
      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>Previous generation incubators are dated and required modern design and upgraded features and GUI to be competitive. There is a need to offer run dry conditions for incubators where the customer is operating without added water and current instrumentation is not optimized for this application. Handle design needs to be modern along with display position under customer install conditions. </p>
    </section>

    <section id="solution">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>Exploration of controls to respond dynamically to changing CO2 concentration when the door is not opened is important to maintain the CO2 concentration during harvesting under high density culturing particularly with G-Rex bioreactors. Run dry conditions needs to be optimized with level sensor alarms disabled and ideal for closed reactors. Update of the electronics is needed along with GUI and display updates. The design should confer ease of use from a user interaction perspective </p>

    <section id="innovation">
      <h2>Innovation</h2>
      <p>Electronics were updated with new PCBA and Display and GUI. The design of the door was modernized to integrate the display holder and the door handle in one configuration to facilitate significant easy of use to the customers since any portion of the handle can help open the door. Further the display can be placed optimally when units are stacked and both left handed and right handed configurations for the door placement is supported confering significant ease of use. Cell & Gene Therapy workflow was improved by providing dynamic control of the level of CO2 within the incubator. Other innovations were included to assure that the unit responded fast to humidity changes when the door was opened and closed. Also the run dry was optimized to ensure good performance under this condition. The unit was easy to clean and all surfaces were accessible. Patents were filed on key features. </p>

      <h2>Value</h2>
      <p>The new generation Heracell Vios provides significant ease of use to the customer from a door opening and display access perspective. The GUI was modernized to confer ease of use. The dynamic control and run dry mode expanded the applications to CGT. The cleanability was improved making it less prone to contamination for critical applications </p>
