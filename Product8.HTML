    New Generation Ion Chromatography High-tier Systems

      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>Legacy High-tier systems require modern features and differentiation to be adopted by customers in the future. Customers need usage information and easy installation of consumables for ion chromatography. Support of advanced applications such as dual EGC was also absent in the present systems. Customer ease of use when operating consumables such as eluent generator and suppressors were the key drivers. </p>
    </section>

    <section id="solution">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>Installation and use information needs to be available on prem. Ability to use smaller particle packed columns can improve the speed of separation and can reduce the eluent usage. A combination of RFID and 1-wire was needed to keep consumable install and performance information facile. Development of a dynamically regenerated suppressor and eluent generator standby mode that allows the eluent generator to startup faster were key features. </p>

      <h2>Innovation</h2>
      <p>In addition to redesigning the system to support RFID and 1-wire to support consumable monitoring and offer a consumable device monitor software and tablet app. Access to consumable installation guides and troubleshooting knowledge base was available increasing the ease of use. The DRS suppressor provided ease of use and improved performance since the user no longer needed to setup the suppressor currents for a given application and improved performance was achieved under gradient conditions. A new standby mode for the eluent generator module allowed fast startup times of the system upon restart after shut down. A dual EGC mode was developed to extend the RFIC applications for complex carbohydrate analysis. Several enhancements were patent protected.

      <h2>Value</h2>
      <p>The design elements were aligned to provide improved system uptime for customers. Monitoring of consumable wellness parameters and alerts that provide feedback to the customer about the care needed to maintain optimum performance. Automated consumable configuration checks prevent installation errors. Less downtime, more results. Ease of use was established through software and consumable operations as indicated. The system provided versatile and efficient separations for ion analysis and was future ready to accomodate many future needs. </p>
